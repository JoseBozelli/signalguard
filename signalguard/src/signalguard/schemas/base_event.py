"""
Domain-neutral event correlation base (Zone B / reusable foundation).

Encodes the *shape* of an account-scoped, correlation-ID-linked event without knowing anything about a specific
event vocabulary:

- `ref_id`: the ID of the lifecycle instance this event belongs to
- `related_ref_id`: an optional cross-lifecycle reference

which event types requires a ref_id, which must NOT carry one, and which are allowed to carry a related_ref_id is
vocabulary-specific knowledge -- that lives in each application's own event module (e.g., SignalGuard's event.py),
which calls `validate_correlation_ids()` from its own validator, passing its own rules sets. This keeps the mechanic
reusable without this module ever enconding SignalGuard's (or any other application's) specific event types.
