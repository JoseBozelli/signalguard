"""
JSONL execution tracing for SignalGuard.

Persists one JSON line per investigation, capturing enough detail to
reconstruct what happened without re-running the pipeline: which
documentation chunks were retrieved, what was extracted (or why the
model abstained), which tool was selected, and the final verdict. This
is deliberately a thin, pure-I/O layer -- it takes already-computed
trace data (e.g. from pipeline.orchestrator.InvestigationTrace) and
writes it; it never calls an LLM or embedding API itself, so it is fully
testable without network access.
